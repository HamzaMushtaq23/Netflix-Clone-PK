# Netflix-Clone-PK
🎬 Netflix Clone (HTML & CSS Only)
A simple static clone of the Netflix homepage built using only HTML and CSS. This project replicates the visual design and layout of Netflix, including header navigation, banner section, and content carousels.

⚠️ Note: This version does not include JavaScript functionality and is not yet responsive.

🔧 Features:

Clean HTML5 & CSS3 structure

Styled navigation bar and hero section

Grid-based layout for movie/TV content thumbnails

Inspired by Netflix’s official UI

📌 Next Steps:

Make the layout fully responsive for all screen sizes

Add JavaScript to implement interactivity (e.g., sliders, login pop-ups)
